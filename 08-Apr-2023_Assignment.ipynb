    "When predicting house prices using an SVM regression model (or any regression model), several metrics can be used to evaluate the performance of the model. Some of the commonly used regression metrics include:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1.    Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: This is the average of the absolute differences between predicted and actual values. It provides a linear penalty for each unit of difference between the predicted and actual values.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.    Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: This is the average of the squared differences between predicted and actual values. It provides a quadratic penalty for errors, meaning larger errors are penalized more heavily than smaller ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3.    Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: This is the square root of the MSE and is one of the most commonly used metrics for regression. Like the MSE, it gives a higher weight to larger errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4.    R-squared (Coefficient of Determination)**: This metric measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables. It provides a measure of how well the model's predictions match the actual data. An R2R2 value of 1 indicates perfect prediction, while an R2R2 value of 0 indicates that the model does not improve the prediction over the mean of the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5.    Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)**: This metric provides the average of the absolute percentage differences between predicted and actual values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that the context is predicting house prices:\n",
    "\n",
    "*    RMSE is often preferred because it provides a more interpretable value (in the same units as the target variable) and penalizes larger errors more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's load the dataset and see some basic statistics to get a better understanding of the data and then decide on the metric."
