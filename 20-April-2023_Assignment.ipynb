    "**3.Cross-Validation:** Use cross-validation techniques, such as k-fold cross-validation, to assess the performance of your KNN model for different values of K. Cross-validation helps you estimate how well the model will perform on unseen data. Plot the accuracy or other performance metric against different K values and choose the one that provides the best results.\n",

The point at which the error starts to level off or form an \"elbow\" is often considered a good choice for K.\n",
